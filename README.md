# ml-mastery-lab

My dedicated space for building a rock-solid foundation in machine learning — from math fundamentals to production-grade models.

This repository contains:
- Structured notes from courses, books, and papers
- Hand-written code exercises and small projects
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
- Daily/weekly progress logs

Goal: Become capable of independently designing, implementing, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models — with a clear path toward MLOps specialization.

## Current Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Math Foundations

- **Linear Algebra**:  
  Scalars, Vectors, Tensors, Matrix & Matrix Operations, Dot product & cosine similarity, Norms & distances, Determinants, Inverse of Matrix, Eigenvalues & Diagonalization, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- **Single-Variable Calculus**: Limits, derivatives, integrals, chain rule, optimization basics
- **Multivariable Calculus**: Partial derivatives, gradients, Jacobian, Hessian (intro)
- **Statistics**:  
  Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance/standard deviation, quartiles), Graphs & Charts, Inferential statistics basics
- **Probability**:  
  Core concepts of Probability, Conditional probability, Bayes' Theorem, Random Variables, PDFs, Types of Distribution (normal/Gaussian, uniform, binomial), Correlation & covariance

### Phase 2 – Python Data Tools
- NumPy: arrays, broadcasting, vectorized operations
- Pandas: DataFrames, cleaning, grouping, merging
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: plotting distributions, correlations
*Practice*: Kaggle datasets

### Phase 3 – Core ML Concepts
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- Train/test split, overfitting, cross-validation
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, MSE, precision/recall, F1)
- Bias/variance tradeoff

### Phase 4 – scikit-learn & First Models
- Pipelines: preprocessing + modeling
- Regression (Linear, Ridge), Classification (Logistic, KNN, Decision Trees)
- Clustering (KMeans), Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Model tuning (GridSearchCV), ensembles (Random Forest)

### Phase 5 – Production & MLOps Basics
- MLflow: experiment tracking & model registry
- BentoML: model serving
- Evidently: drift & performance monitoring
- Basic deployment: FastAPI + Docker

## How I Track Progress
- Daily commits: notes, code snippets, or small experiments
- Weekly review: what I learned, what confused me, next focus
- Milestones: complete each phase → build a small working model

## Tools & Setup
- Python 3.11+
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, mlflow
- Environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
